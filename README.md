Hello everyone!!

My name is David, I came across a YouTube tool on Reddit that updated livestream thumbnails to the most recent frame based on a time interval similarly to how it is done on twitch.tv
I wanted to update the program, unfortunately LiquidDegu the original developer hasn't been able to respond to my message to become a collaborator on the original GitHub repo, so I'll leave the updates I have made
and possibly will keep making on this program here!

I also have the source code available in the repo too so it can be reviewed by others and possibly even updated furthermore!
Once again keep in mind the original work and idea is all thanks to LiquidDegu, I was only motivated to improve the program.

**To compile the program:** simply drag the main.py file into a valid Python Compiler/IDE and install all required libraries.

**To run the program:** I did build the app as a Windows only application as Windows is all that is available to me, for all Windows users simply just run the .exe and all should be well.

**Utilizing the program:** Is as simple as following LiquidDegu's GitHub Wiki tutorial that I will link below
*(Setup Google Cloud Console -> Open the program -> Provide necessary info [Video ID, Credentials, Time Interval in Seconds] -> Start/Stop the program when necessary [active state will update bottom left])*

**I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** leaving the program inside of a folder and creating a shortcut to it as the thumbnail that will be set for the YouTube Livestream will automatically save to the same folder location
as the executable file with the name "thumbnail.png" (if you want to avoid the clutter of that single file)
